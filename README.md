#Twitter Grammar Bot
####*Updated: April 26, 2014*

Actually the reason I took up this project was because I want to learn how to parse data from web sites. I still do not have a clear on what use this is to my life but I read on some threads that people create bots that automatically does this so they donâ€™t have to manually check the stuff they have to constantly monitor.

One of the things I learned from the script is the use of BeatifulSoup which is a module that takes data from text files. This is actually actually all we need for the project as what we only require is the list of commonly misspelled words.

I also learned pickling! Now this is the one of the most amazing tools I have ever encountered. It basically lets you save any object to a file so you can use it later, i.e., either on another script or another computer. The reason why pickling is useful in this project is because its inefficient to parse the commonly mispelled words from Wikipedia every time we run this.

Twitter's API should also be used for this project to work.
